# Event Parser

## Using Node 8+

`npm install` in the root directory of this project

## Start the server

`node server.js` to start things

## Parse

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and click on the parse button. It will retrieve some feed data from the URL specified in `server.js`.

## Firebase

Not installed yet. Eventually the `/parsefeed` route will be the main route so that when this script runs on a schedule the web interface is not necessary.
